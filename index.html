                            One of Liyue's traditional snacks. The stuffing is taken from whole fresh shrimp,

                            as a springy, tasty chew.

                            A traditional snack from Liyue. The fresh dough is turned out into a round, rested,

                            before being fried quickly in an oiled wok. When eaten, the fried condiments must be placed 
                            into the empty space in the middle of the buns before they are eaten together. Between the 
                            crisp vegetables and the flavorful meat, this is solid, great flavor.

                            before being garnished with whole shrimp and steamed in a pot. The resulting design is like 
                            that of clouds embracing the moon, hence the name Fullmoon Egg.

                            A fragrant salad dish. Finely chopped Jueyun Chilis blended with a sauce and mixed with Mint leaves. It looks like nothing special, 
                            but it has surprisingly potent powers of refreshment and reinvigoration. It is also the perfect palate-cleanser after a greasy, indulgent meal.

                            Such pastries are usually stamped with the word "Mora," all the better to represent wealth and fortune.

                            they were placed into the broth and cooked till they floated. The resulting flavor is light and fresh, and would not be out of

                            Colorful staple food. Maintains perfect balance between soft and fragrant rice 
                            and all kinds of carefully selected sweet ingredients. This dish is mainly known 
                            for its meaning as a symbol of prosperity and peace, and less so for its taste. 
                            However, with such noble ideals behind it, its flavor should not disappoint.
